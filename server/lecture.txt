CORS :- cross origin resourse sharing.

backend is running on localhost and port is :4000

//http:notes.app.com

react app frontend: localhost:3000

--> any frontend be able to request you? --> cleient side ? Ans :NO 
//http:notes.app.netlify.com

cross origin --> different origin 
-->frontend
-->backend

--> Cors : allows you to define which client or frontend should be able to request you.

cors({origin: 'https:notes.app.netlify.com'}) //only localhost:3000 can request 3001
cors({origin: '*'}) any frontend can request you

register and login system

-->user schema and model
--> while registering will be hashing password with bcrypt
--> while logging we will be comparing the password using bcrypt and creating a token with the help of jwt

noteModel:
title
description
status
userId==> id of UserModel(mongodb id)

-->3 kind of relationships
1-1 ,1-many, many-many

a user can create multiple notes:
user - 1
notes-many(userId)

1-many relationships


==> model is done
==> route for it -->to access these route the user should be authenticated
==> to check the authentication ==> auth middleware
